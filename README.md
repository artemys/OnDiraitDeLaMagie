# On Dirait De La Magie !


A little Micro-services architecture project
Cf [Readme](https://github.com/rbobillo/OnDiraitDeLaMagie/tree/master/documentation) from the `reference` branch

Through the Harry Potter theme, I wanted to realise a first big project in go. Using Docker to contenize different actor of this world. And using rabbitMQ (as Owls) to make them communicate.

Work In Progress ! 
Currently I have isolate every part into branches. But the goal is to unit them and make the world spin.

This is a Graph representation of my project. More on [Documentation](https://github.com/rbobillo/OnDiraitDeLaMagie/tree/master/documentation)
